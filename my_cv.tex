\section{Education}
\cventry{2011 -- 2013}{Yandex School of Data Analysis}{}{}{}{}
\cventry{2009 -- 2014}{Specialist (equivalent to Master's degree) in Mathematics}{Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia}{\newline GPA -- 5.0 / 5}{}{}{}{}


\section{Work experience}
\cventry{May 2018 -- now}{Google Switzerland}{Senior Software engineer}{Google Shopping, Bidding Team}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Working on cutting edge bidding solutions, which account for a significant chunk of Google Shopping revenue.
		\item Detected several major bugs in autobidding implementation, fixes of which statistically significantly improved the quality of traffic \textbf{(+5\% CVR uplift on eCPC)}.
		\item Implemented new bidding strategies and solutions, which did not exist in Google Shopping before (eCPC for Value, Coop, target ROAS improvements).
		\item Used Recurrent Neural Networks for session-based optimizations, \textbf{brought AUC-PR up by 20\%} (TFX based modeling).
		\item Improving user trust by implementing bidding strategy statuses logic for SSC campaigns.
		\item Helped facilitating cross org effort to migrate external ad stack (SA360) to Google Ads infra (Amalgam project), which involved \textbf{communicating directly with over 4 teams}, took ownership of pieces outside of the scope of my team
		\item Occasionally taking and solving complicated Google-wide infra issues. Examples include fixing bug in TF matrices ops which \textbf{brought +8.8\% AUC-PR and -1\% logloss} to TpCVR model which is queried for all Shopping PLA candidates. Another example is fixing googlesql python client when it was breaking in multithreading context under python3, which facilitated py3 migration.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Aug 2017 -- March 2018}{Yandex}{Team Leader, Senior Software Engineer}{Advertising Services, Autobidding Team}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The main focus is on supporting and improving backend of automatic bidder for Yandex Direct.
		\item Introducing new ideas and algorithms to be implemented in automatic bidder.
		\item Managing an organized work of the team.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Jul 2016 -- Aug 2017}{Yandex}{Senior Software Engineer}{Advertising Services, Projects Management Team}{}{

		\item Managing related projects in other teams.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Sep 2012 -- Jun 2015}{Yandex}{Software Engineer}{Advertising Services, Algorithms of Fraud Detection}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Developing new fraud traffic filtration algorithms.
		\item Developing automatic Anomalies Detection system, which is able to notify users on anomalies in advertisement traffic.
		\item Integrating Anomalies Detection system with Anomalies Analyzer system, that is, anomalies in advertisement traffic, which are found by Anomalies Detection system, are passed to be analyzed to Anomalies Analyzer service.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Jul 2012 -- Sep 2012}{Yandex}{Software Engineer Intern}{Advertising Services}{}{
